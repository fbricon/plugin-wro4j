Forge plugin for wro4j
======================

This Forge plugin adds some basic [ro.isdc.wro4j:wro4j-maven-plugin](http://code.google.com/p/wro4j/wiki/MavenPlugin) configuration to web projects.
wro4j-maven-plugin provides a build time solution for Web Resource Optimization (minification, obfuscation ...)

In the Forge console, make sure you are in the root directory of your project and just type

       forge> setup wro4j

When using Eclipse and m2e, it's recommended to install [m2e-wro4j](https://community.jboss.org/en/tools/blog/2012/01/17/css-and-js-minification-using-eclipse-maven-and-wro4j)..

This Forge plugin was quickly hacked, as a way to study the Forge API, so its scope is very limited
